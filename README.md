# pine-tree
An interactive Dartmouth course map that shows progression and course dependancy.

Course dependency is parsed from the Dartmouth ORC with Python; then Python is used to create a file containing node and edge information; finally the graph is rendered using Cytoscape.js.

Built by Anoush Khan, Bridger Holly, and Matt Levine -- all Dartmouth '21s.
